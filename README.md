v.map

v.map is a project made for the "Community Volunteers Foundation/Toplum Gönüllüleri Vakfı (TOG)". TOG is an organization with around 65k volunteers and the majority of them are students working from their cities/towns/villages.

Our web application aims to help them answer/create "needs" and organize them in an efficient manner the way "İhtiyaç Haritası" does it. 

Volunteers will be able to create their needs in a spesific way: We need "x" amount of notebooks in school "y". and it will be displayed on the map of Turkey. Moreover, if volunteers have things for a giveaway they will also be able to enter it to this system. 

Users will also be able to filter the needs depending on distance, topic etc.
